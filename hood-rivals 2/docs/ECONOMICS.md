# Economy and launch specification

## Separation of systems

**Supply** is a match-only strategic resource: start 5, normal per-round income 3, two paid income upgrades maximum, captured supply posts add income, total round income capped 6 and carried supply capped 15. It cannot be bought, transferred or redeemed. **XP** is nontransferable reputation. **RIVAL** is optional external cosmetic payment; holding more never changes combat.

Cosmetic prices start at 4/6/8/12 USDG. RIVAL quotes use the operator's explicitly configured `TOKEN_UNITS_PER_DOLLAR`, fixed for the signed five-minute quote. This is a merchant tariff, not a validated market price. Until the operator sets and monitors that tariff, RIVAL checkout is disabled. USDG is a payment asset, not a guarantee against depeg. Gas is additional.

## Canonical launch

Planned token: Hood Rivals / RIVAL. Robinhood Chain mainnet 4663, o1 Standard with USDG quote asset. The o1 Standard launch model uses a fixed 1 billion token supply into the launch liquidity pool. This design does not reserve a team, treasury, rewards or airdrop allocation. Do not publish an allocation pie chart that contradicts the actual launch. Read current configuration and the prepared plan; if the launch product changes, stop and revise the documents before signing.

No developer buy is included in preparation. Creator trading-fee income, if paid by the launchpad, is a separate contingent revenue source; the game does not depend on that income. Opening launch fees can differ drastically from normal trading fees. Review current o1 disclosure and avoid implying a flat fee during the opening period.

## Contract-enforced splits

| Checkout | Creator | Treasury | Dead address |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| First-party RIVAL | 0% | 80% | 20% |
| First-party USDG | 0% | 100% | 0% |
| Future creator RIVAL | 90% | 8% | 2% |
| Future creator USDG | 90% | 10% | 0% |

Integer rounding remainder goes to treasury. Retirement destination: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`. These transfers do not decrement token `totalSupply`; use **retirement**, not claims of native supply burning. Transfers are atomic and fee-on-transfer incoming assets are rejected. The contract does not control the external token's admin powers; inspect them separately.

## Business model

Revenue comes from voluntarily purchased visual identity. A match is fully playable for free, including ranked. No paid retry, supply top-up, loss insurance, withdrawal penalty or required daily streak. Monetization is cosmetics, future curated creator sales, and optional separately negotiated sponsorship; sponsorship and creator publishing are not implemented.

`npm run economics` produces assumption-based scenarios. Example: 10,000 monthly players × 3% paying × $8 spend = $2,400 gross equivalent. If half pays RIVAL, 20% retirement on that half leaves $2,160 treasury equivalent before costs. Against $3,000 operating cost, the scenario loses $840. Token receipts may realize less after volatility and liquidity costs. This deliberately does not assume token appreciation subsidizes operations.

Demand must come from players who want the cosmetics. A retirement rule creates a usage-linked sink, but it cannot ensure token price increases. No emissions are used to disguise negative retention or economics.

## Launch measurement

Measure first-match completion, D1/D7 player return, repeat matches, invitation-to-first-game conversion, payer conversion, net realized revenue, support burden and cost per active player. Instrument with a privacy-reviewed analytics provider before a public growth campaign; this release stores account match results and purchase receipts, not a full analytics warehouse.

Proposed product gates, not measured results: observe enough playtests to find repeated reasons to return, resolve dominant strategies and mobile friction, validate actual cosmetic willingness to pay, and demonstrate purchases without support intervention. A launchpad listing is distribution infrastructure, not evidence the game is fun.
