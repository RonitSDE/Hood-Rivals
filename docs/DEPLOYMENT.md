## v1.4.1 paid-release gate

The store was changed to prevent a wallet paying twice for the same cosmetic. Deploy this version of `OutpostStore`; older deployments will fail the new purchase-guard preflight and disable checkout. Set `TREASURY_ADDRESS` to the exact immutable contract treasury. Build and scan the production container image; see `../reports/SECURITY_V1.4.1.md`. Gameplay may run with checkout disabled.

# Deployment and operations

## Hosting

Build with Node24. Use `npm ci` and the committed lockfile. For Docker, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set production `APP_ORIGIN=https://your-host`, keep secrets outside source control, then `docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml up -d --build`. Point a TLS reverse proxy at private port3000; an example Caddyfile is included. Configure your domain and certificates. `/healthz` is liveness; `/readyz` checks the database.

Run exactly **one API process/replica**. SQLite WAL and its volume must be persistent. Multiple Node processes could run overlapping timers and are unsupported here. The reverse proxy should provide distributed/public rate limiting; the service's per-IP limit is an additional local bound. It intentionally does not trust arbitrary forwarded IP headers.

Do not expose `.env`, SQLite, backups, launch preparations or deployer keys. Dist is the only served static directory. The runtime user is non-root. The Docker runtime layer prunes development dependencies; production still executes TS through `tsx`. Never bake secrets into the image.

## Keys and roles

- Wallet user: signs an explicit login challenge; session is HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, production Secure.
- Quote signer: dedicated server signing key, no permission to transfer a user's funds. It can issue prices and creator payout addresses, so compromise still affects merchant economics. Rotate via multisig owner and pause checkout during incidents.
- Contract owner: multisig recommended, can pause/unpause and rotate signer. Treasury and asset addresses are immutable; redeploy for a change.
- Deployer: offline/developer-run only; remove from production environment after deployment.
- o1 API key: developer launch preparation only, not needed by the running game.

## Receipt recovery

The browser saves submitted payment hash and order ID before waiting for confirmations. Retry confirmation from Armory after interruption. Server accepts only a successful canonical receipt, configured contract event, exact order/payer/asset/amount/SKU and configured confirmation count. Fulfilment is idempotent. Users should retain the hash independently. A receipt confirmed before a deep chain reorganization requires operator reconciliation; automatic deep-reorg rollback is not implemented.

## Backups and restore

Run `npm run backup` with the app environment. Copy the produced snapshot to encrypted off-host storage. Test restore by stopping the API, replacing the DB with a backup, preserving permissions, and restarting. SQLite online `VACUUM INTO` makes a consistent snapshot. Backup order inventory and receipts with the database; losing it loses cosmetic entitlement history unless reconstructed from chain and order metadata.

## Release checklist

- Full build/tests/simulations pass; inspect `reports/`.
- Test incognito guest, refresh/restart recovery, two browsers in one room, idle timeout, daily limit, wallet restoration.
- On Robinhood testnet, connect and sign; create an Emberhold, Tidewatch or Sunreach captain; verify its name and faction in the living island, persisted account stats after refresh, match gating before onboarding and checkout gating until onboarding. Reconnect an existing wallet and check its previous account is restored without merging guest progress.
- Desktop/mobile visual and WebGL QA, reduced-motion setting, keyboard controls, screen-reader labels, wallet rejection/chain switching. These need real browser testing before launch.
- Robinhood testnet mock lifecycle: transfer funds, approve exact amount, buy each asset, confirm, equip, retry duplicate confirmation, pause/reject.
- Validate o1 launch preparation against current live API, review chain/address/supply/fees and sign fresh unexpired plan separately.
- Mainnet contract review/audit, token-admin inspection, multisig roles, private RPC and alerting.
- Mainnet preflight, tiny purchase, explorer receipt, entitlement, accounting reconciliation.
- Privacy/terms, refund policy, trademark clearance for Hood Rivals/RIVAL, jurisdiction-specific token and payment review.
- Keep checkout disabled if any payment integration is unverified; gameplay can launch separately.

## v1.3 additions

Read `FINAL_HANDOFF.md`. Back up SQLite before the additive rival_memory migration. Set `BUILD_SHA`, and the exact `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` for your host (default0). Use one replica with durable storage. Authentication limits are account scoped after IP-limited session issuance; this does not imply production load or Sybil resistance.
